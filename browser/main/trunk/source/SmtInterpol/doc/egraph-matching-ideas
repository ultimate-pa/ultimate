E-Matching and Congruence-Closure

The objects of class CCTerm build an equality-graph, 
which is a set of equivalence classes of all elements appearing
in our formula.  For handling triggers in quantifiers we need
to match elements from this graph with a pattern, which contains
place-holders.  The idea is to use a simple language for matching
and compile patterns into this language.

The basic language consists of the following statements:
  find(f/k,j,x):  Find an arbitrary application term with 
      function symbol f/k and store it into reg[j] and its
      arguments into reg[j+1],...,reg[j+k].  Transfer 
      control to x for each match.
  bind(i,f/k,j,x): Find an application term with function
      symbol f/k in the equivalence class of reg[i] and
      store its arguments into reg[j],...,reg[j+k-1]. Transfer 
      control to x for each match.
  reverse(i,f/k,n,j,x): Find a function application f/k, such that 
      reg[i] is the n-th argument of f and store it into reg[j] and
      the other arguments into reg[j+1]..reg[j+k-1]. Transfer 
      control to x for each match.
  compare(i,j,x): Check if reg[i] is equivalent to reg[j]. Transfer 
      control to x on success.
  yield((i_1,...i_n), C) return C{reg[i_1],...,reg[i_n]}.
  goto([x_1,...,x_n]): Transfer control nondeterministically 
      to x_1,...,x_n.  (used to combine multiple trigger)  
      
The registers of a trigger may be initialized arbitrarily, to contain
constant terms occurring in the pattern.  The method find is the most
complex one and should be avoided if it can be replaced by reverse or
bind.
      
A pattern matches, if there is a sequence ending in a yield 
statement.  There is a lot of non-deterministic branching, for
example the find and bind function can non-deterministically choose
some function application.

Every time a bind/reverse statement is executed, and every time a
compare statement fails, the incremental algorithm annotates
the corresponding CCTerm reg[i] with the current program location and
register contents so that it can be re-executed on merges. 

A compare trigger is re-activated only when the CCTerm with the trigger
is merged with such that the trigger points to that equivalence class.
The trigger can afterwards be removed (and needs to be reinserted 
on split).

A reverse trigger is re-activated when the CCTerm with the trigger is
merged with another CCTerm with an CCpar entry for that
func symbol and only if this does not lead to a congruence edge.

A bind trigger is re-activated when the CCTerm with is merged with another
CCTerm that contains in its equivalence class a corresponding function
application and the function application was not the reason for this merge.


Likewise for each find statement the function symbol is annotated so
it will re-execute if a new function application is created.


=====================================================================

Reuse matches vs. create and congruate.

Take as an example array select/store axiom:
ALL a i j v { (select (store a i v) j) } @
  (= i j) , (= (select (store a i v) j) (select a j))
ALL a i j v { (select (store a i v) j) } @
  !(= i j), (= (select (store a i v) j) v)
When the pattern matches, there is already a term equivalent to
(select (store a i v) j) in the e-graph, but in most cases it is
really a different term and relies on other equalities to be congruent.
There is the possibility to reuse this term and add all the necessary
equalities to the new clause.  The other possibility is to create the
exact term, apply congruence closure and add the clause using the newly
created term.  Congruence closure will ensure that this leads to roughly
the same state.  However this requires a lot of work.  It is better to
only create new terms if an equivalent is not existing.

There may be several terms that are congruent to (select (store a i v) j)
under different equality literals.  So should we add all or rely on
congruence closure?   It is enough if only one of the congruent application
is considered for each find/bind/reverse rule.

We still need to create new terms, for example (select a j) in the above
axioms.  This term may then be used to match a new pattern if a is 
equivalent to some (store b i v).

==================================================================

Example patterns:
  (select (store ?a ?i ?v) ?j)
gets translated to
  (find select/2 0 (bind 1 store/3 3 (yield (3,4,5,2) CLAUSE))))
or slightly faster:
  (find store/3 0 (revfind 0 select/2 0 4 (yield (1,2,3,5) CLAUSE))))

  (select (store ?a ?i ?v) ?i)
gets translated to
  (find store/3 0 (revfind 0 select/2 0 4 (compare 2 5 (yield (1,2,3) CLAUSE)))))
or even
  (find store/3 0 (revfind 2 select/2 1 4 (compare 0 5 (yield (1,2,3) CLAUSE)))))

Simple pattern:
  ($typed S p)
-->
  (find $typed/2 0 (yield (1,2) CLAUSE))
Note, that this is evaluated once at creation time.
It only needs to be executed for every newly created $typed application.

Multi pattern:
  ($typed ?S ?p) ($typed ?S ($emb(?S ?p))
-->
  (find $emb/2 0             % find ($emp S p)
    (reverse 0 $typed/2 1 2  % find ($typed ? ($emp S p))
      (compare 1 3           % test if S matches
        (reverse 2 $typed/2 1 2   % find ($typed ? p) 
          (compare 1 3            % test if S matches. 
            (yield (1,2) CLAUSE))))))
if the parameter S is more diverse then this may be faster:
  (find $emb/2 0             % find ($emp S p)
    (reverse 1 $typed/2 0 2  % find ($typed S ?)
      (compare 0 3           % test if ($emp S p) matches
        (reverse 1 $typed/2 0 2   % find ($typed S ?) 
          (compare 2 3            % test if p matches. 
            (yield (1,2) CLAUSE))))))
   
Another multi pattern:         
  ($is_primitive ($typ ?p)) ($owner ?S ?p)
-->
  (find $owner/2 0
    (reverse 2 $typ/1 0 0
      (reverse 0 $is_primitive/1 0 0
        (yield (1,2) CLAUSE))))
  
Partly constant pattern:
  ($typed $int p)
-->
  reg[0] = $int ; (reverse 0 $typed/2 0 (yield (1) CLAUSE))
