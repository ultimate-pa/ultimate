This is a special release of Ultimate with a wrapper script to run our
Trace Abstraction Concurrent setting. Using this setting you can verify
concurrent Boogie programs that use our conventions (i.e., each procedure
is a thread). Some examples for boogie programs that follow this convention
can be found in the "examples" folder.
    


Requirements:
64bit Linux system with Java



Usage:
If you want to analyze termination of the program foo.bpl then execute the
shellscript
./AutomizerConcurrent.sh foo.bpl
