SMT script generated by Ultimate LassoRanker [1].
Ultimate LassoRanker is a tool that analyzes termination and nontermination of 
lasso-shaped programs. This script contains the SMT commands that Ultimate 
LassoRanker used while checking if a lasso-shaped program has a geometric 
nontermination argument. (See [2] for a preliminary definition of
geometric nontermination argument.)

This SMT script belongs to a set of SMT scripts that was generated by applying
Ultimate Buchi Automizer [3,4] to the benchmarks from the SV-COMP 2016 [5,6] 
which are available at [7]. Ultimate Buchi Automizer takes omega-traces
(lasso-shaped programs) and uses LassoRanker in order to check if the 
lasso-shaped program is terminating.
