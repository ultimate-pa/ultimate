Abstract:
Ultimate Buchi Automizer implements a novel approach to termination analysis 
that mimics human case-by-case reasoning.
The tool decomposes a program semantically into modules such that each module 
represents a case for which a "simple" termination arguments exists.
This decomposition is constructed on demand, guided by termination arguments
that we infer from lasso shaped code fragments. These termination arguments are
obtained via synthesis from the build in tool LassoRanker.


Download instructions:
Our competition candidate is a modification of the software analysis framework 
Ultimate and can be downloaded at the following URL.
https://ultimate.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/BuchiAutomizer/


Installation instructions:
Our competition candidate requires Java (1.6 or higher), Python and the SMT
solver Z3. (https://z3.codeplex.com/)
We expect each release of version 4.3.2 is suffcient, but we recommend to
install the nightly Ubuntu x64 build of the unstable branch 
z3-4.3.2.ff265c6c6ccf-x64-ubuntu-12.04.zip which is available at the following
URL. https://z3.codeplex.com/downloads/get/751842
We require that the Z3 executable is available in your path.


Instruction for running the tool:
The zip archive in which Ultimate Automizer is shipped contains the python 
script automizerSV-COMP.py which wraps input and output for the SV-COMP.
If you want to verify the C program fnord.c with property file prop.prp
and write an error path to file errorPath.txt then you have to use the directory
where you extracted the zip archive as your working directory and execute the
following command:
python AutomizerSvcomp.py prop.prp fnord.c errorPath.txt
