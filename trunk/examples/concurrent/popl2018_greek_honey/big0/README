Note that there are many variants of the benchmark in the "variants" directory.
You need to manually select the variant that you want to run.
This can be done simply by moving all the variants you do _not_ want somewhere
else (i.e., leave only the variant you want in the "variants" directory).

The variant we used for the table in the paper is "big00.c".
