//#Unsafe

/*
 * We can prove this program incorrect for 5 threads, but we fail for bigger
 * numbers (like 10, 10000, ...), although the actual number does not matter.
 * The program is unsafe for any number of threads. A feasible error trace
 * forks all threads, but does not execute them at all. Therefore x remains 0.
