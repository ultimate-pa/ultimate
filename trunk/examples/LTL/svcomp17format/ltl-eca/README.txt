C programs for LTL property verification taken from [RERS challenge problems](http://rers-challenge.org).

The benchmarks were contributed by Daniel Dietsch and Vincent Langenfeld ([Ultimate](https://ultimate.informatik.uni-freiburg.de)).

The usage of the RERS challenge problems was authorized by Bernhard Steffen (RERS committee member):

Hi,

Of course, we are happy if the benchmarks are used, in particular, also for SV-COMP.
Your mail initiated us to think about the most appropriarte licences (e.g Apache, MIT,??).
As usual in the scientific community, we would only like that the origin is mentioned/cited.

In fact, we want to establish a larger open source Benchmark repository, and cooperation here would be wonderful.
For now, please go ahead and use the Benchmarks. We will soon provide an appropriate official licensing comment. 

Beste Regards

Bernhard Steffen
