C programs for LTL property verification.

The benchmarks were contributed by Daniel Dietsch and Vincent Langenfeld ([Ultimate](https://ultimate.informatik.uni-freiburg.de)).

The tasks 01-* to 05-* are taken from "B. Cook and E. Koskinen. Making prophecies with decision predicates. In ACM SIGPLAN Notices, volume 46, pages 399â€“410. ACM, 2011."
The tasks coolant-* are toy examples provided by V. Langenfeld that are modelled after real-world embedded systems with specifications based on the LTL patterns described in "A. C. Post. Effective Correctness Criteria for Real-time Requirements. Shaker, 2012."
