The benchmarks were contributed by Daniel Dietsch and Vincent Langenfeld ([Ultimate](https://ultimate.informatik.uni-freiburg.de)).

The tasks are taken from "B. Cook and E. Koskinen. Making prophecies with decision predicates. In ACM SIGPLAN Notices, volume 46, pages 399â€“410. ACM, 2011."
They contain examples from "[...] the I/O subsystem of the windows kernel, the back-end infrastructure of the PostgreSQL database server, and the Apache web server".
