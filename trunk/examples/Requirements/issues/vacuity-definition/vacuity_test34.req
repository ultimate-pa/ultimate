Input var1 is bool
Input var2 is bool
Input var3 is bool
Input var4 is bool
Input var5 is bool

Constraint_assumption: Globally it is always the case that "!var3" holds

req1: After "var1" until "var2" It is always the case that If "var3" holds, then "var4" previously held and was preceded by "var5"
