Input var3 is bool
Input var4 is bool
CONST MAX_TIME is 50.0
Input var2 is bool


req1: Globally It is always the case that After "var3" holds for at least "MAX_TIME" time units, then "var4" holds
req2: Globally It is always the case that If "var3" holds, then "var2" toggles "!var4" at most "MAX_TIME" time units later
