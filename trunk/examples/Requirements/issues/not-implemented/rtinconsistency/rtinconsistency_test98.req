CONST time_at_least is 30.0
Input var3 is bool
Input var4 is bool
CONST MAX_TIME is 50.0
Input var1 is bool



req1: Before "var1" It is always the case that If "var3" holds for at least "time_at_least" time units, then "var4" holds afterwards
req2: Before "var1" It is always the case that After "var3" holds for "MAX_TIME" time units, then "!var4" holds
