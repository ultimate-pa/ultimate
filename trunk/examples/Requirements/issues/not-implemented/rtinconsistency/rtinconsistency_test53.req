Input var3 is bool
Input var4 is bool
Input var5 is bool
CONST MAX_TIME is 50.0



req1: Globally It is always the case that If "var3" holds, then there is at least one execution sequence such that "var4" holds after at most "MAX_TIME" time units
req2: Globally It is always the case that If "var3" holds, then "var5" toggles "!var4" at most "MAX_TIME" time units later
