Input var3 is bool
Input var4 is bool
CONST MAX_TIME is 50.0
CONST time_every is 10.0
Input var2 is bool



req1: Globally It is always the case that "var4" holds at least every "time_every" time units
req2: Globally It is always the case that If "var3" holds, then "var2" toggles "!var4" at most "MAX_TIME" time units later
