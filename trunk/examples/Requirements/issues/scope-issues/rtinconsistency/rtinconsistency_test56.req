Input var4 is bool
CONST time_at_least is 30.0
Input var1 is bool
CONST time_every is 10.0



req1: Before "var1" It is always the case that once "var4" becomes satisfied, it holds for at least "time_at_least" time units
req2: Before "var1" It is always the case that "!var4" holds at least every "time_every" time units
