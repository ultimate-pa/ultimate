Input var1 is bool

Input var4 is bool
Input var5 is bool
Input var6 is bool

Constraint_assumption: Globally it is always the case that "!var3" holds

req1: Before "var1" It is always the case that If "var3" holds, then "var4" eventually holds and is succeeded by "var5" where "var6" does not hold between "var4" and "var5"
