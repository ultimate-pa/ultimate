Input var1 is bool
Input var2 is bool
Input var3 is bool
Input var5 is bool
CONST MAX_TIME is 50.0

Constraint_assumption: Globally it is always the case that "!var3" holds

req1: After "var1" until "var2" It is always the case that After "var3" holds for at least "MAX_TIME" time units, then "var5" holds
