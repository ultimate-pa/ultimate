Input A is bool
Input B is bool

req1: Globally, it is always the case that if "A" holds, then "!B" holds for at least "10" time units.
req2: Globally, it is always the case that if "A" holds, then "B" holds as well.


// Reqs silently enforce that !A always holds. For req1, this is detected as vacuity, but req2 cannot be vacuous  because invariants cannot be vacuous
