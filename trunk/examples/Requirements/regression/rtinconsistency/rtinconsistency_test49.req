Input var3 is bool
Input var4 is bool
CONST MAX_TIME is 50.0
CONST time_at_least is 30.0



req1: Globally It is always the case that If "var3" holds, then "var4" holds for at least "time_at_least" time units
req2: Globally It is always the case that If "var3" holds, then there is at least one execution sequence such that "!var4" holds after at most "MAX_TIME" time units
