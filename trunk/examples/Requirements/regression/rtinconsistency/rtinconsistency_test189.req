Input var2 is bool
Input var4 is bool
CONST MAX_TIME is 50.0
Input var1 is bool



req1: Between "var1" and "var2" It is always the case that "var4" holds at least every "time_every" time units
req2: Between "var1" and "var2" It is always the case that If "var3" holds, then there is at least one execution sequence such that "!var4" holds after at most "MAX_TIME" time units
