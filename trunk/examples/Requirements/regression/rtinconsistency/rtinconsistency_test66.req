CONST time_less_than is 20.0
Input var3 is bool
Input var4 is bool
CONST MAX_TIME is 50.0
Input var1 is bool



req1: Before "var1" It is always the case that once "var4" becomes satisfied, it holds for less than "time_less_than" time units
req2: Before "var1" It is always the case that If "var3" holds, then "!var4" holds after at most "MAX_TIME" time units
