Input var3 is bool
Input var4 is bool
CONST MAX_TIME is 50.0
Input var1 is bool



req1: After "var1" It is always the case that After "var3" holds for "MAX_TIME" time units, then "var4" holds
req2: After "var1" It is always the case that If "var3" holds, then "{S}" toggles "!var4" at most "MAX_TIME" time units later
