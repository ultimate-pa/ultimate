// #TestSpec: rt-inconsistent:req1+req2; vacuous:; inconsistent:; results: 4
Input a is bool

req1: Globally, it is always the case that once "a" becomes satisfied, it holds for less than 5 time units.
req2: Globally, it is always the case that once "a" becomes satisfied, it holds for at least 15 time units.

// Silently enforces !a but is not detected as vacuity.
// This is not a vacuity as both requirements can reach their maximal phase in the parallel composition.
