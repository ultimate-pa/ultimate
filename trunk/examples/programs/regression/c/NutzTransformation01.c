//  - before comparisons (this includes relational operators, equality 
//        operators and checks if a value is (un)equal to zero)
//  - before conversions to signed data types, 
//  - before casts to unsigned data types if the resulting data type has a 
//        larger size, and
//  - before division and modulo operations.
