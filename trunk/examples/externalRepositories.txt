Further examples can be found in the following repositories.
 * SVCOMP: https://github.com/dbeyer/sv-benchmarks
 * ultimate-benchmarks: https://github.com/ultimate-pa/ultimate-benchmarks.git

Notes:
 * Read the rest of the file before you start 
 * You should clone in a different folder than the Ultimate folder.  
 * You might want to do a sparse checkout for svcomp to avoid pulling unnecessary files 
 * Because our tests expect the additional examples in a special place, you should symlink them. 
   For Linux, use a symlink to map the folders to our examples folder: 
   ln -s /storage/svcomp/c /storage/ultimate/trunk/examples/svcomp
   ln -s /storage/ultimate-benchmarks /storage/ultimate/trunk/examples/ultbench
   
   For Windows, open "cmd" as Administrator and use mklink:
   mklink /D Drive:\path\to\ultimate-repo\examples\svcomp Drive:\path\to\svcomp-repo\c
   mklink /D F:\repos\ultimate\trunk\examples\ultbench F:\repos\ultimate-benchmarks
 

Long paths with git and Windows 
  * Windows does not support long paths, which may be a problem for various repositories you can clone here. 
  * For Windows 10, you can enable long path support in git and in Windows itself
    Open "Edit Group Policy"
	Goto Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System -> Filesystem 
	Set "Enable Win32 long paths" to Enabled 
	Open "Git Bash" with Admin rights 
	Run "git config --system core.longpaths true" 
 
Sparse-checkout with git 
  * We assume you want to make a fresh clone. 
  * create a directory
    mkdir svcomp
  * make it a fresh git repository
    git init
  * add the remote from which you want to pull later 
    git remote add origin https://github.com/dbeyer/sv-benchmarks
  * tell git that you want to use sparse checkouts
    git config core.sparsecheckout true
  * create a file that will describe what you want from the remote repo, e.g. by using touch 
    touch .git/info/sparse-checkout
  * say that you, e.g., only want the folder c/ containing the C benchmarks 
    echo c/ >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
  * get all your benchmarks without the history ("--depth=1")
    git pull origin master --depth=1

The whole directory will then be approx. 5GB

If you for some reason modify the sparse-checkout file, you have to run the
following command (from your repo root) to inform git about your change: 
git read-tree -mu HEAD
