Input state IS int
Input R IS bool
Input S IS bool
Input U IS bool
Input V IS bool

ID003: After "state == 1 "  until "state != 1 " , it is always the case that if "R" holds, then "S" holds after at most "5" time units
ID004: After "state == 2 " until "state != 2", it is always the case that if "U" holds, then "V" holds after at most "5" time units
