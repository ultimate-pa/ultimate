/**
 * A Result that carries the information for all the possible uses of a C string literal. There are two uses:
 * <li>for initializing an array, then we use the characters of the string directly, the extra char[] field has this
 * function
 * <li>for modeling C's special (read-only) memory area for string literals; for this we use the ExpressionResult
 * aspects of this class, where we store the allocation- an write-statements and an RValue that points to the beginning
 * of that memory area.
 *
 * <p>
 * <br>
 *
 * Overview about the treatment of string literals in C according to the C11 standard: Summary of 6.4.5 for our
 * purposes:
 * <li>String literals have static storage duration. They are stored in their own memory area, writing to that area is
 * undefined behavior.
 * <li>When a string literal is stored, it is automatically terminated by a '\0'-character (in case it is stored into a
 * char[], the \0 may be dropped if the char[] is not large enough).
 * <li>The type of a string literal is char[].
 * <li>If a string literal is used for initializing a char[], its contents are copied into the char[]'s memory location.
 * (An exception to the 'no array assignments'-rule in C.) Assigning a string literal to a char[] outside of
 * initialization is forbidden.
 * <li>If a string literal is used for initializing, or assigning to, a char*, then the pointer points to the
 * (read-only) memory location of the string literal afterwards.
 * <li>string literals may or may not be unified (and even overlapped??) in their memory area. This is implementation-
 * defined. (example: 'char *p = "bla"; char *q = "bla";' after executing this code, p and q may or may not be equal,
 * depending on the C compiler.)
