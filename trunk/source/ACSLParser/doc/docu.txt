GENERAL INFORMATION

ACSLParser is a part of ULTIMATE project.
The aim of ACSLParser project is to scan and parse ACSL annotations that
are present in C files. Most of this package are automatically generated
files.

FILE INFORMATION

Package: [de.uni_freiburg.informatik.ultimate.acsl.parser]
	Contains Parser and Scanner files generated by JavaCup - tools for
	syntactical analysis.
Package: [de.uni_freiburg.informatik.ultimate.model.acsl]
	Contains an abstract class ACSLNode that will be extended by AST classes.
Package: [de.uni_freiburg.informatik.ultimate.model.acsl.ast]
	Contains generated by ASTBuilder classes.
	
DETAIL INFORMATION

1. GRAMMAR:
- 	The actual grammar file is called "GlobalLocalParser.cup". It is based on the
	original Frama-C grammar, parts which are not in the ACSL standard were removed
	and some there are some changes which are necessary to use it with JavaCup.
-	Some parts are still missing in the grammar, so for example the handling of
	"Ghost Code" (Frama-C interprets it as C-Code) or Weak/Strong Invariants.
	
2. ACSL-AST:
-	The AST (acsl.ast) can build with the project ASTBuilder, but because we 
	have to extend the superclass ACSLNode, this project must be changed to
	fetch different superclasses.
-	There are still some problems with the Expressions in the AST. The structure
	is taken by the Boogie-AST, but more complex Expressions are not interpreted
	the right way, in such case we give back "NotDefinedExpression", this is not
	a syntax error moreover an AST problem.
-	Another problem is the assignment of line numbers to parsed ACSL-Nodes,
	now this works not very intelligent, there is space for improvement.
