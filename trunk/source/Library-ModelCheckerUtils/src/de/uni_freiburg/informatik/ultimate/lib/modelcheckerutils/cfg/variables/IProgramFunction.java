/**
 * Represents an function in the program. Note that we use the notion of Boogie here, where a function is not a
 * procedure but a side-effect free deterministic mapping, i.e., the function always returns the same values for the
 * same input. However, the function does not have to be completely specified, i.e. if we apply a function f to a domain
 * value d the resulting value will always be the same value r but the function definition does not have to specify
 * which concrete value r actually is.
