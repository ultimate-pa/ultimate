package de.uni_freiburg.informatik.ultimate.lib.modelcheckerutils.taskidentifier;

/**
 * Objects of this type (and its subclasses) are only used to generate strings.
 * In several parts of Ultimate we would like to have unique identifiers for
 * dumping things (e.g., SMT scripts, automata, pathprograms) to files.
 * Using local information for generating the strings was not sufficient.
 * E.g., a TrackCheck can be done 
 * <ul>
 * <li> while checking if a MapElimination was an overapproximation 
 * <li> while checking termination, 
 * <li> while checking for the existance of a danger invariant in a path program
 * <li> in iteration 42 of a CEGAR loop
 * <li> while verifying the 23rd specification of
 * <li> an input program whose filename is x.
 * </ul>
 * Each {@link TaskIdentifier} takes the {@link TaskIdentifier} of its parent
 * task (null if topmost) and can generate a stings that identifies the current
 * subtask (e.g., Iteration42). The generation of the subtask string is defined
 * by the subclasses of this class.
 * These {@link TaskIdentifier} form a singly linked list and strings are 
 * constructed each time anew, but performance is irrelevant here.
