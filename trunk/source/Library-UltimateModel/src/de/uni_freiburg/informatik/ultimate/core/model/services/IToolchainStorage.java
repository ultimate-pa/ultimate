 * {@link IToolchainStorage} is a toolchain-persistent storage that provides {@link IToolchainPlugin}s with the
 * possibility to store information related to one {@link IToolchain} execution. At the end of the lifetime of a
 * {@link IToolchain}, the core will destroy the storage (i.e. call {@link IStorable#destroy() and clear the storage}.
 *
 * There you can release all resources that need to be released (e.g. close file handlers).
 *
 * Ultimate's {@link MonitoredProcess} already uses the {@link IToolchainStorage}, so you don't need to care for that.
