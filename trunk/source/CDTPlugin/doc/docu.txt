GENERAL INFORMATION

CDTPlugin is an extension of ULTIMATE project.
The aim of CDTPlugin is that ULTIMATE is usable for regular C-Developers.
So that they can verify their programs directly out of their Eclipse CDT.
To realize this this plugin extends the Codan-Interface (Code Analysis), which
is part of Eclipse CDT. To read more about Codan observe the following link:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/designs/StaticAnalysis   

FILE INFORMATION

Package: [de.uni_freiburg.informatik.ultimate.cdt]
	Contains decorator nodes that encapsulate the C nodes and ACSL nodes.
	Contains also traversal algorithms that perform BreaddthFirstSearch
	and DepthFirstSearch needed for AST-tree traversal.
	
Package: [de.uni_freiburg.informatik.ultimate.cdt.codan]
		
		- [UltimateCChecker]
		This class is somehow the base class of this plugin, it extends
		AbstractIndexASTChecker, so it obtains in process method an already
		parsed AST. This AST is passed to UltimateServices where we store it
		for the translation. Since Ultimate must always start with a source
		plugin, we use the CDTDummyParser, which basically takes the set AST
		from UltimateServices and passes it to next tool in the toolchain.
		When the toolchain is finished the results are presented to the user.
		Therefore there exists different problem types, which are declared in
		the plugin xml.
		
		So for example the following lines define a codan problem:
		<problem
        	category="org.eclipse.cdt.codan.core.categories.Ultimate"
            defaultEnabled="true"
            defaultSeverity="Info"
            description="Ultimate found an Invariant"
            id="de.uni_freiburg.informatik.ultimate.cdt.codan.InvariantResult"
            messagePattern="Ultimate found an Invariant here, &apos;&apos;{0}&apos;&apos;"
            name="Ultimate Invariants">
        </problem>
        
        - [UltimateCCheckerHelp]
		This provides information for the "CodanProblemDetailsView", this view
		provides some additional information for a certain problem to the user.
		This view is very limited, there are only two SWT-Widgets "Link". Which
		not allow any formating of the displayed text. In general the main problem
		of Codan is the very limited UI behavior. Another problem of this kind is
		in the preferences, the choosing of the toolchain should work dynamically,
		for this a dropdown-box would be helpful, but this simply not exist.
		        
        - [CCheckerDescription]
        This class externalized strings, which are used in the plugin.
