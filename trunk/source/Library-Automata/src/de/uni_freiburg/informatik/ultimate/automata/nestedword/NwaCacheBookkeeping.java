/**
 * If you write a nested word automaton that computes its transitions on demand, then use this class to store which
 * transitions have already been computed.
 * <p>
 * Use this together with {@link NestedWordAutomatonCache}.<br>
 * Problem solved by this class: Assume you query an on-demand built automaton for a transition, the automaton checks
 * its cache and returns null. Does this mean there is no such transition or does this mean the transition was not yet
 * computed? If you want to distinguish both cases, you have to do some bookkeeping to remember which transitions have
 * already been computed.
