/**
 * Interface for all automata operations (like, e.g., intersection, complementation, minimization).<br>
 * We have the following conventions.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Each operation is defined in its own class.
 * <li>Whenever you want to apply an automata operation, you construct a new object instance of this class. Arguments
 * are passed via the constructor.
 * <li>The result is returned via the {@link #getResult()} method.
 * <li>Start and end of the operation are reported to the logger using log level <tt>INFO</tt>
 * <li>Correctness checks for this operation are implemented in the checkResult method. Whoever executes this operation
 * should add an <blockquote> {@code assert} {@link #checkResult(IStateFactory)} </blockquote> in his code.
 * </ul>
 * By convention the constructor of an IOperation has the following parameters.
 * <ul>
 * <li>The fist parameter are the {@link AutomataLibraryServices}. If the operation is executed by the automata script
 * interpreter, the interpreter will use the {@link AutomataLibraryServices} of the current toolchain as an argument.
 * <li>If the IOperation requires a {@link IStateFactory}, the {@link IStateFactory} should be the second parameter. If
 * the second parameter is a {@link IStateFactory}, the automata script interpreter uses a {@link StringFactory} as
 * argument.
 * <li>The remaining parameters of the constructor are the parameters of the operation (i.e., the parameters for which
 * you provide arguments in an .ats file). It is good practice to have a default constructor with a minimal number of
 * arguments, and optionally other constructors with more arguments. The minimal constructor should be considered the
 * default for .ats files.
 * </ul>
