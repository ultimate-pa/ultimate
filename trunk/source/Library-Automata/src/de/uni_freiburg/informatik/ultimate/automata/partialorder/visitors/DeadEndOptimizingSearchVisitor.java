/**
 * A visitor that implements a dead-end removal optimization. Each instance can be used in multiple traversals, if it is
 * reset in between traversals. From each traversal, it remembers backtracked states and marks them as dead ends. In
 * future traversals, the successors of such dead ends are not explored. Additionally, states can be explicitly marked
 * as dead ends.
