 * An interface that supports identifying post-scripts of a certain language.
 *
 * A set of transitions T of a Petri net N is called a post-script of a language L iff for all firing sequences sigma of
 * N, it holds that if for all t in T such that sigma.t is a firing sequence, label(sigma.t) is in L, then simply
 * label(sigma) is already in L.
 *
 * In other words, firing a transition in T cannot make a non-accepted prefix into an accepted word.
 *
 * For an example, consider {@link InfeasPostScriptChecker}.
 *
 * @param <L>
 *            The type of the letters in the Petri net.
 * @param <P>
 *            The type of the places in the Petri net.
