 * Part of a {@link NestedWordAutomaton}'s configuration. <tt>up</tt> is the state in which the automaton is.

 * For many algorithms (e.g. determinization) we do not have to use configurations (current state + stack) of the
 * automaton, the {@link DoubleDecker}s are sufficient.<br>
 * In "JACM2009 - Alur,Madhusudan - Adding nesting structure to words" a {@link DoubleDecker} is called "summary state",
 * but to avoid clashes in variable names I decided to use this name.
