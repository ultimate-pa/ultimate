/**
 * This is the superclass of all incremental minimization classes.
 * <p>
 * The idea is to use threading. One thread controls the state of the interrupt and one thread runs the minimization.
 * This is the caller's job.
 * <p>
 * Whenever the first thread decides to stop the minimization, it informs the interrupt. The minimization is expected to
 * regularly check the state of the interrupt and if it should terminate it stops its normal execution and only
 * constructs the result from the information it has gathered so far.
