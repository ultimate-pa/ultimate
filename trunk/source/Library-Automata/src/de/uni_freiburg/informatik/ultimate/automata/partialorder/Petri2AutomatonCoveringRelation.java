/**
 * A covering relation for automata created from one-safe Petri nets.
 *
 * A marking n is covered by a marking o if for all places p in n, either p is in o, or p has no successors and is not
 * accepting.
 *
 * This means that if e.g. one thread has reached a dead end location (e.g. an error location that is checked in another
 * CEGAR loop), then the resulting marking is covered by a marking where the thread is still running, and all other
 * threads are in the same location as before.
