    In this paper, we explore the potential of the theory of nested words for partial correctness proofs of recursive programs.  Our conceptual contribution is a simple framework that allows us to shine a new light on classical concepts such as Floyd/Hoare proofs and predicate abstraction in the context of recursive programs.  Our technical contribution is an interpolant-based software model checking method for recursive programs.   The method avoids the costly construction of the abstract transformer by constructing a nested word automaton from an inductive sequence of `nested interpolants' (i.e., interpolants for a nested word which represents an infeasible error trace).

    Automatic refinement of abstraction is an active research
    theme in static analysis. In existing approaches, calls to theorem provers
    (for the construction of a sequence of increasingly precise state abstractions)
    represent an obstacle to scalability. We present an approach that
    aims at the reuse of theorem prover calls. The abstraction is based not on
    states but on traces. Each refinement extends a tuple of automata with
    another automaton; this automaton is derived from the interpolant-based
    analysis of a spurious counterexample.
