/**
 * Converts a list of edges into a string using the Trivial Graph Format (TGF) file format.
 * TGF files can be interpreted as directed or undirected graphs –
 * this information itself isn't stored in TGF files.
 * <p>
 * The graph has to be enumerated manually using {@link #addEdge(N, Object, N)}
 * (and {@link #addDisconnectedNode(N)} if there are any disconnected nodes).
 * The resulting TGF is returned by {@link #toString()}.
 * <p>
 * Nodes in the graph are identified by object equality according to {@link Object#equals(Object)}
 * and labeled using the canonical string representation {@link Object#toString()}. The same edge
 * can be added multiple times. {@code null} nodes and edge labels are supported.
 * <p>
 *
 * @param <N> Type of the nodes in the graph. It is perfectly fine to use {@code Object} here.
 *            However, you might want to use a more concrete type to prevent accidentally using the wrong
 *            objects as nodes.
