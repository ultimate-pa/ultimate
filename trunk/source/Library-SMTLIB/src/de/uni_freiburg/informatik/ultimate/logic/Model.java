/**
 * A minimal interface for model queries. The model should represent the model generated by an SMT solver. It should be
 * detached from the solver, i.e., a model retrieved from a solver should not be invalidated by an assertion stack
 * command. Note that the model is not a model of the assertion stack at that time, but we want to give the user the
 * freedom to use the model in an interactive way. Note that symbols defined by model generation might be removed once
 * the assertion stack level is popped off the stack.
 *
 * Values for numeric sorts in linear arithmetic logics are {@link ConstantTerm ConstantTerms} whose value is of type
 * {@link Rational}. For non-numeric sorts, we return some term of the corresponding sort. No further guarantees are
 * made.
