/**
 * This class does a recursive algorithm by using an explicit stack on
 * the heap.
 *
 * If you need a stateless walker, you can just implement Walker.  If
 * your goal is to walk terms, then TermWalker may help you, as it already
 * dispatches the walk function based on the type of the term. A simple
 * term walker can be created as:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class MyWalker extends TermWalker {
 *    MyWalker(Term term) { super(term) }
 *    walk(NonRecursiveWalker walker, final ApplicationTerm appTerm) {
 *       walker.addWorkItem(new NonRecursive.Walker() {
 *          public void walk(NonRecursiveWalker walker) {
 *             // ... code that should run after parameters are processed
 *          }
 *       }
 *       for (Term param : appTerm.getParameters()) {
 *          walker.enqueueWalker(new MyWalker(param));
 *       }
 *    }
 *    walk(... // handle other term classes...
 * </pre>
 *
 * For stateful walker you need to extend the class NonRecursive.  In
 * addition you still need a Walker class that does the job.  It can
 * access the state by casting NonRecursive.
 *
 * Results can be added in a stateful walker to an additional result
 * stack.  See FormulaUnLet as an example.
