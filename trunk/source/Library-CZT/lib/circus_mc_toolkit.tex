% extra definitions used by the model checker VC generation engine.

%   Calculates the minimal set of a set of sets.

%   It is used in the normalisation algorithm for Circus automata
%   while calculating minimal sets of coalesced (power) states.

%   Set difference distributed over set of sets.
%   It is used for in the operational semantics of parallelism.
%   LaTeX char equivalent to \searrow.
%   The associativity is the same as \setminus.
%   The binding power of this operator template is slightly tigher than \setminus (30).

%   Set intersection distributed over set of sets.
%   It is used for in the operational semantics of parallelism.
%   LaTeX char equivalent to \lozenge(?).
%   Alternative unicode to use U+22C4, which has LaTeX equivalent as \diamond.
%   The associativity is the same as \cap.
%   The binding power of this operator template is slightly tigher than \cap (40).
%   We haven't used 45 because it has already been taken by a \rightassoc operator
%   in sequence_toolkit.tex (\_ \extract \_).
