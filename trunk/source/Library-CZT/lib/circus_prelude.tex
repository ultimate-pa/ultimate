% Like the Z standard prelude, the Circus prelude defines the basic keywords
% and operators for the Circus language. It MUST NOT depend on any other toolkit,
% otherwise a cyclic recursion might occur. The right way to specify user toolkits
% for Circus is to have the circus_prelude or circus_toolkit as a parent.
% circus_toolkit inherits the circus_prelude and standard_toolkit.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Mark-up directives for core language symbols are as follows:
% The choice for pre, in, or post, has to do with how one wants
% the character to be rendered. See Z Std A.2.3.2.
%
% By using keychars, such as \circguard instead of &, we allow
% appropriate rendering by both LaTeX and Unicode mark-ups.

% TODO: Normalise the keywords and keychar latex names.
% TODO: Use just \circthen for both guarded commands and prefixing?
