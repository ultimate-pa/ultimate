/**
 * <p> Provides classes for handling and manipulating text, partly as an extension to {@link java.text}.
 * The classes in this package are, for the most part, intended to be instantiated (i.e. they are not utility classes
 * with lots of static methods). </p>
 *
 * <p>Amongst other classes, the text package provides a replacement for {@link java.lang.StringBuffer} named {@link org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrBuilder}, a class for substituting variables within a String named {@link org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrSubstitutor} and a replacement for {@link java.util.StringTokenizer} named {@link org.apache.commons.lang3.text.StrTokenizer}.
 * While somewhat ungainly, the {@code Str} prefix has been used to ensure we don't clash with any current or future standard Java classes. </p>
 *
 * @since 2.1
