/**
 * <p>
 * Definition of an interface for the thread-safe initialization of objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The idea behind this interface is to provide access to an object in a
 * thread-safe manner. A {@code ConcurrentInitializer} can be passed to multiple
 * threads which can all access the object produced by the initializer. Through
 * the {@link #get()} method the object can be queried.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Concrete implementations of this interface will use different strategies for
 * the creation of the managed object, e.g. lazy initialization or
 * initialization in a background thread. This is completely transparent to
 * client code, so it is possible to change the initialization strategy without
 * affecting clients.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 3.0
 * @param <T> the type of the object managed by this initializer class
