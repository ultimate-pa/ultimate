/**
 * <p>
 * An implementation of the {@code ThreadFactory} interface that provides some
 * configuration options for the threads it creates.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@code ThreadFactory} is used for instance by an {@code ExecutorService} to
 * create the threads it uses for executing tasks. In many cases users do not
 * have to care about a {@code ThreadFactory} because the default one used by an
 * {@code ExecutorService} will do. However, if there are special requirements
 * for the threads, a custom {@code ThreadFactory} has to be created.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class provides some frequently needed configuration options for the
 * threads it creates. These are the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A name pattern for the threads created by this factory can be specified.
 * This is often useful if an application uses multiple executor services for
 * different purposes. If the names of the threads used by these services have
 * meaningful names, log output or exception traces can be much easier to read.
 * Naming patterns are <em>format strings</em> as used by the {@code
 * String.format()} method. The string can contain the place holder {@code %d}
 * which will be replaced by the number of the current thread ({@code
 * ThreadFactoryImpl} keeps a counter of the threads it has already created).
 * For instance, the naming pattern {@code "My %d. worker thread"} will result
 * in thread names like {@code "My 1. worker thread"}, {@code
 * "My 2. worker thread"} and so on.</li>
 * <li>A flag whether the threads created by this factory should be daemon
 * threads. This can impact the exit behavior of the current Java application
 * because the JVM shuts down if there are only daemon threads running.</li>
 * <li>The priority of the thread. Here an integer value can be provided. The
 * {@code java.lang.Thread} class defines constants for valid ranges of priority
 * values.</li>
 * <li>The {@code UncaughtExceptionHandler} for the thread. This handler is
 * called if an uncaught exception occurs within the thread.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * {@code BasicThreadFactory} wraps another thread factory which actually
 * creates new threads. The configuration options are set on the threads created
 * by the wrapped thread factory. On construction time the factory to be wrapped
 * can be specified. If none is provided, a default {@code ThreadFactory} is
 * used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instances of {@code BasicThreadFactory} are not created directly, but the
 * nested {@code Builder} class is used for this purpose. Using the builder only
 * the configuration options an application is interested in need to be set. The
 * following example shows how a {@code BasicThreadFactory} is created and
 * installed in an {@code ExecutorService}:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Create a factory that produces daemon threads with a naming pattern and
 * // a priority
 * BasicThreadFactory factory = new BasicThreadFactory.Builder()
 *     .namingPattern(&quot;workerthread-%d&quot;)
 *     .daemon(true)
 *     .priority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY)
 *     .build();
 * // Create an executor service for single-threaded execution
 * ExecutorService exec = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(factory);
 * </pre>
 *
 * @since 3.0
