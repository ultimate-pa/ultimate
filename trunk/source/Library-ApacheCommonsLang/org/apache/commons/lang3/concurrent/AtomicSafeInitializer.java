/**
 * <p>
 * A specialized {@code ConcurrentInitializer} implementation which is similar
 * to {@link AtomicInitializer}, but ensures that the {@link #initialize()}
 * method is called only once.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As {@link AtomicInitializer} this class is based on atomic variables, so it
 * can create an object under concurrent access without synchronization.
 * However, it implements an additional check to guarantee that the
 * {@link #initialize()} method which actually creates the object cannot be
 * called multiple times.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Because of this additional check this implementation is slightly less
 * efficient than {@link AtomicInitializer}, but if the object creation in the
 * {@code initialize()} method is expensive or if multiple invocations of
 * {@code initialize()} are problematic, it is the better alternative.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * From its semantics this class has the same properties as
 * {@link LazyInitializer}. It is a &quot;save&quot; implementation of the lazy
 * initializer pattern. Comparing both classes in terms of efficiency is
 * difficult because which one is faster depends on multiple factors. Because
 * {@code AtomicSafeInitializer} does not use synchronization at all it probably
 * outruns {@link LazyInitializer}, at least under low or moderate concurrent
 * access. Developers should run their own benchmarks on the expected target
 * platform to decide which implementation is suitable for their specific use
 * case.
