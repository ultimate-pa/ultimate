/**
 * This package contains all classes needed to create hybrid systems and hybrid automata from parsed inputs. We need a
 * separate package for visibility reasons. To create a the desired models, use the appropriate factory classes which
 * have public access modifiers. Visibility should restrict creating hybrid system instances from the classes
 * themselves.
