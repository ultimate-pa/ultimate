/**
 * An {@link IIpTcStrategyModule} acts as a constructor for an {@link IInterpolatingTraceCheck} (<b>I</b>nter<b>p</b>
 * olating<b>T</b>race<b>c</b>heck) used in {@link IRefinementStrategy}s.
 *
 * Usually, {@link IInterpolatingTraceCheck} implementations do all their work directly in the constructor to avoid
 * creating mutable state. Hence, these wrapper classes are necessary to allow an {@link IRefinementStrategy} to create
 * an {@link IInterpolatingTraceCheck}s on demand.
