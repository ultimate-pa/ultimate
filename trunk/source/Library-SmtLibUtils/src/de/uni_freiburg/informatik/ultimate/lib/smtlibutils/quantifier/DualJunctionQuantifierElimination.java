	 * result becomes a correspondingJunction
	 * <p>
	 * If the quantifier is an existential (resp. universal) quantifier this method
	 * returns an array of {@link Term}s <code>result</code> such that
	 * <code>∃ eliminatees. ⋀ dualJuncts</code> is equivalent to
	 * <code>∃ eliminatees'. ⋀ result</code> (resp.
	 * <code>∀ eliminatees. ⋁ dualJuncts</code> is equivalent to
	 * <code>∀ eliminatees'. ⋁ result</code>) where eliminatees' refers to the
	 * content of the set after this method was executed.
	 * <p>
	 * Which and how many variables from the set <code>eliminatees</code> can be
	 * removed depends on the quantifier elimination algorithm that implements this
	 * method.
	 * <p>
	 * Every variable that was successfully eliminated is removed from the set.
	 * However, due to formula simplifications some variables might get removed
	 * accidentally. Hence, there might be variables that are not removed from the
	 * eliminatees set but do not occur in the resulting terms.
