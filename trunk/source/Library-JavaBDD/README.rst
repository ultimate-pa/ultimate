JDD

JDD is a decision diagram library written in pure java. It supports 
`Binary Decision Diagrams <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram>`_ (BDD) and 
`Zero-suppressed Decision Diagram <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-suppressed_decision_diagram>`_ (Z-BDD or just ZDD).

The JDD code tree contains some additional stuff that will be moved out in near future:
 * BDD domains
 * CNF structures + some simple "algorithms" [e.g. GSAT]
 * graph structures + some simple algorithms [e.g. MST, shortest-path]
 * exprimental structures for handling discrete-event systems.  [Petri Nets, finite automata, bounded strings]
