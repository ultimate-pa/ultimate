		<h2><a name="Project description"></a>Project description</h2>
		<p>JavaBDD is a Java library for manipulating BDDs (Binary Decision Diagrams). 
			Binary decision diagrams are widely used in model checking, formal 
			verification, optimizing circuit diagrams, etc. For an excellent overview of 
			the BDD data structure, see this set of <a href="http://www.itu.dk/people/hra/notes-index.html">
				lecture notes</a> by Henrik Reif Andersen.</p>
		<p>The JavaBDD API is based on that of the popular <a href="http://www.itu.dk/research/buddy/">
				BuDDy</a> package, a BDD package written in C by Jørn Lind-Nielsen. 
			However, JavaBDD's API is designed to be object-oriented. The ugly C function 
			interface and reference counting schemes have been hidden underneath a uniform, 
			object-oriented interface.</p>
		<p>JavaBDD includes a 100% Java implementation. It can also interface with two 
			popular BDD libraries written in C via a JNI interface: <a href="http://www.itu.dk/research/buddy/">
				BuDDy</a> and <a href="http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/cuddIntro.html">CUDD</a>.
		</p>
		<p>JavaBDD is designed for high performance applications, so it also exposes many 
			of the lower level options of the BDD library, like cache sizes and advanced 
			variable reordering.</p>
		<h2><a name="Download"></a>Download</h2>
		<p>The latest version is <b>0.6</b>.</p>
		<ul>

				Win32 binary: <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/javabdd/javabdd_0.6.zip?download">
					javabdd_0.6.zip</a>

		</ul>
		<h2><a name="Compiling"></a>Compiling</h2>
		<p>It is easiest to download one of the pre-built binaries. If you want to build it 
			yourself with the interface to BuDDy and/or CUDD, you will also need the BuDDy 
			(and/or CUDD) source code, available from the <a href="http://www.itu.dk/research/buddy/">
				BuDDy homepage</a> (and/or the <a href="http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/cuddIntro.html">
				CUDD homepage</a>).</p>
		<p>Grab the JavaBDD source code from CVS. To build JavaBDD on Windows, you will 
			need cygwin or mingw installed. The Makefile assumes that you have the BuDDy 
			source code in buddy22/src. It will automatically identify the path to the JDK, 
			as long as you have it installed in the default location (C:/j2sdk* on Windows, 
			/usr/java/j2sdk* on Linux). Finally, do a <tt>"make"</tt> and everything should 
			work. Other make targets are "examples", "javadoc", "jar", and "test".</p>
		<p>CUDD uses the Makefile.cudd makefile. To build, do a "make -f Makefile.cudd". 
			The CUDD makefile contains the same targets as the normal BuDDy makefile.</p>
		<p>If you manage to successfully compile JavaBDD for another system, please 
			contribute your Makefile and/or any source patches.</p>
		<h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h2>
		<p>Download the binary archive for your system and extract the files. It you want 
			to use the native BuDDy library, put the "buddy.dll" (on Windows) or 
			"libbuddy.so" (on Unix) somewhere in your library path, or in the directory you 
			will execute from. (JavaBDD will automatically search the current directory for 
			the native library, so there is no need to specify the current directory in the 
			"java.library.path" system property.) Add the JavaBDD jar file to your Java 
			class path if you want to compile and/or run with JavaBDD.</p>
		<p>The JavaBDD jar file contains a simple example that solves an NxN queens 
			problem. You can run this example by simply typing:</p>
		<p><tt>java -jar javabdd_0.6.jar</tt> <i>N</i></p>
		<p>where <i>N</i> is the size of the board (e.g. 8).</p>
		<h2><a name="Performance"></a>Performance Comparison</h2>
		<p>Here are the timings of solving the 12x12 NQueens problem on my home machine 
			(2.4GHz P4, WinXP, Sun JDK 1.4.2). This test simply does simple logic 
			operations. It primarily tests the speed of node creation and BDD garbage 
			collection. The command line I used to test was:</p>
		<p><tt>java -ms320m -mx320m -Dbdd=<i>package</i> -jar javabdd_0.6.jar</tt> <i>N</i></p>

		<p>Don't make any assumptions from these results about the relative efficiency of C 
			and Java. The Java source code is a direct translation of the C source code, 
			and therefore there are many, many inefficiencies that would not be present if 
			it had been implemented from scratch in Java. At best, you could use this 
			information as an example of the type of performance you will see if you 
			directly translate a performance library written in C into Java.</p>
		<h2><a name="History"></a>History</h2>
		<p><i>Version 0.6 - October 31, 2003</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Fixed security problems by adding better null and type checking.  It should
			no longer be possible to crash the VM by passing in unexpected values.
			<li>
			Updated API:&nbsp;applyWith(), etc.&nbsp;methods return the&nbsp;'this' 
			pointer, for easier nested operations.
			<li>
			Addition of typed BDD factory, for type checking of BDD code.
			<li>
				Code cleanups. JNI interface was made a few percent faster by moving
				object allocations into Java code.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><i>Version 0.5 - August 4, 2003</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Major update. Added a 100% Java implementation of the BDD factory, so the 
			native library is no longer necessary.
			<li>
			Java implementation of variable domains. Domains can be up to 2^64 in size!
			<li>
			Java implementation of bit vectors, along with the associated operations (add, 
			subtract, multiply, divide, etc.)
			<li>
			Fixes and extensions to the CUDD interface. Now CUDD can run all of the test 
			cases correctly.
			<li>
				More small refinements to the API.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><i>Version 0.4 - June 18, 2003</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Added an interface to the CUDD library. Only basic operations have been 
			implemented and tested. Many features (like variable domains) have not been 
			implemented/ported yet.
			<li>
			Improved the support for printing of BDDs. Now you can specify an interface 
			that will convert the domain indices/members into meaningful strings.
			<li>
				Some small updates to the API. Notably, scanSet() now takes a BDDDomain object, 
				rather than a domain number.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><i>Version 0.3 - February 21, 2003</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Many bugs fixed.
			<li>
				Most functionality has been tested, so this version should be moreorless stable 
				and useable.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><i>Version 0.2 - February 1, 2003</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Still largely untested. Proceed at your own risk.
			<li>
			Added support for variable domains.
			<li>
			Added support for variable pairings.
			<li>
			Added support for defining variable orderings.
			<li>
				Fixed some LinkageError exceptions.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><i>Version 0.1 - January 30, 2003</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Initial release. Largely untested.</li>
		</ul>
