# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

#
# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: Ultimate

# The domain & protocol for the site.
url: "https://ultimate-pa.org"

# The basepath of the site.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# We set this here to the same default as FRONTEND_ROUTE in WebBackend.
# This allows for the site to be served by the backend.
# Alternatively, the site can be served by jekyll directly.
#
# When deployed, this should be empty. It can be overridden during build by running
#     jekyll build --baseurl "/"
baseurl: "/website"
