// #Termination

 * 
 * Proving termination of this program is very difficult, because a and b
 * are increasing at "different speeds".
 * 
 * Example that I discussed with Albert, Caterina, Carsten, JÃ¼rgen, Marc 
 * and Thomas on the blackboard at the WST 2014.
 * 
 * Later I discussed it with Amir and Samir via email.
 * They were able to prove that this program does not have a 
 * disjuctive well-founded transition invariant where each disjunct is
 * defined by a linear term.
 * 
 * A ranking function for this program is to the quotient a/b.
