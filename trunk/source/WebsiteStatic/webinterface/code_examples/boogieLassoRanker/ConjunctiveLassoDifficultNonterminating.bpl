 * This is one of two brother examples that may be one of the
 * most difficult conjunctive lassos.
 *
 * The eigenvalues are 1 and 1/2.
 * In an execution, the value of q increases until it reaches almost 55,
 * then decreases to negative infinity.
 *
 * This is the nonterminating brother, because the guard is never violated.
