# ULTIMATE Awards

This directory lists all the awards won by ULTIMATE tools at various competitions.

For each competition instance where an ULTIMATE tool won an award, there is a separate HTML file.
It begins with metadata about the competition and the awards, described in the YAML format, between two lines of three dashes.
A short paragraph of text after the second line of dashes gives a summary of the competition outcome.

The metadata and the summary paragraph are used to render the award on the awards page (`../awards.html`).
The files in this directory only serve this purpose, they do not show up as standalone pages in the compiled site.
