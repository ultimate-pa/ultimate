<h1>Eliminator</h1>

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Ultimate Eliminator</span> is a tool that takes as an input a formula that may contain quantifiers
	and tries to find a logically equivalent formula without quantifiers.
	We call this task <i>quantifier elimination</i>.

	<p>Quantified formulas are notoriously difficult to solve and several state-of-the-art SMT solvers support only quantifier-free formulas.
	Several algorithms that are used in the <a href="{{ 'automizer/' | relative_url }}"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Ultimate Automizer</span></a>
	software verifier produce quantified formulas.
	In order to make these formulas fit for a larger number of SMT solvers and algorithms that require quantifier-free formulas
	the developers of <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Ultimate Automizer</span> implemented several simple techniques that try to eliminate quantifiers.
	For example, one of these algorithms replaces a formula of the form ∃x.φ(x) ∧ x = t by the formula φ(t).</p>
	<p> Our motivation for developing <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Ultimate Eliminator</span>
	was to make these quantifier elimination techniques accessible to users that want to eliminate quantifiers.</p>

	<p> The current version of <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Ultimate Eliminator</span> is only a prototype that should demonstrate the power of
	<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Ultimate</span>&apos;s quantifier elimination techniques.
	This tool is a user interface that
	takes SMT-LIB~2.6 compatible input
	tries to eliminate quantifiers in this input
	and passes the modified input to
	a user defined SMT-LIB 2.6 compatible solver.
	I.e., it is a wrapper for an SMT solver that give this solver capabilities to handle quantified formulas.

<h2>Web Interface</h2>
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Ultimate Eliminator</span> is available via a <a href="{{ 'webinterface/?tool=eliminator' | relative_url }}">web interface</a>.
In this web interface <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Ultimate Eliminator</span> wraps the <a href="https://ultimate.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/smtinterpol">SMTInterpol</a> SMT solver.
</p>


<h2>Input/Output Format</h2>
<p>Currently, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Ultimate Eliminator</span> is only a wrapper for SMT solvers.
We also want to make the quantifier elimination directly accessible to users but have not yet decided for an interface.
Current ideas are a new <tt>eliminate-quantifiers</tt> SMT command or the possibility to pass a formula via the command line.
If you would like to use <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Ultimate Eliminator</span> we are open to other ideas as well.
